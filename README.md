# haskell-sudoku
A simple sudoku solver built in Haskell -- suggestions welcome.

## To Run
For now, there is no interface, so open up the .hs file, and replace the "..." in puzzle="..." with the sudoku puzzle, reading left to right and top to bottom, with blank spaces being 'x' characters.
Then, run ``search [pMap emptyMap puzzle]``
